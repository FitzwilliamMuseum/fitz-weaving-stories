Tapestry panel depicting the story of 'Jacob and Esau'

In time Isaac married Rebecca and had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. As an old man Isaac became blind. When he was nearing his death, he prepared to follow the custom of blessing his oldest son over a meal, signalling that this son should inherit his father’s goods and wealth. Esau was sent out hunting for meat for the meal.

The corners of the arch in the centre of the tapestry were decorated with different flowers: a carnation (left) and borage (right). As with the previous tapestry, the borders are also interesting in their own right. In the horizontal borders are hunting scenes; dogs chase a stag in the upper border

and a fox in the lower border.
